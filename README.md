# Project: Bookworm
Run in Jupyter Notebook.
A simple question-answering system built using IBM Watson's NLP services.

## Overview

In this project, you will use IBM Watson's NLP Services to create a simple question-answering system. You will first use the Discovery service to pre-process a document collection and extract relevant information. Then the Conversation service will be use to build a natural language interface that can respond to questions.



Feel free to work on the project with your own dataset. You can also turn it into a web-based application and deploy it on Bluemix.
